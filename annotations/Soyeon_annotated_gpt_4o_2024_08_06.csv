1,1,250127,,CallSign_Fjor,,What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?,,Original post,,0.0,Inquire,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is ""What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?"" The speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is expressing confusion or curiosity about why their friends lost interest in playing a game after the speaker progressed further in it.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker seems to be seeking an explanation or understanding of a phenomenon they find puzzling. This suggests that the primary intent is to inquire about the reasons behind a specific behavior.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Inquire**: The speaker is asking a question to seek information about why people behave in a certain way.
   - **Claim**: The speaker could be making an implicit claim about their perception of the situation, but the form of the utterance is explicitly questioning.
   - **React**: The speaker is reacting to the situation, but the structure of the utterance is more aligned with seeking an answer.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no strong indication of politeness or impoliteness. The question is neutral and does not appear to contain any elements that would enhance or detract from the addressee's face.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The question does not contain reported speech or non-bona fide elements like sarcasm. It appears to be a genuine inquiry.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate communicative act for this utterance is ""Inquire"" as the speaker is seeking an explanation for the behavior of others.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

It's been a week and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.",,Original post,,0.0,Inform,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance by CallSign_Fjor describes a situation where they played Terraria with friends, progressed further in a single-player mode, and then returned to play with friends. However, their friends lost interest when they found out about CallSign_Fjor's progress.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: CallSign_Fjor is providing a detailed account of their actions and the resulting reactions from their friends. The primary intent seems to be to share a personal experience and explain the situation to the audience. 

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about what happened during the gaming experience, including specific actions taken by CallSign_Fjor and the reactions of their friends. This aligns with the definition of ""Inform"" as providing verifiable information, even though it may be subjective in terms of the friends' reactions.
   - **Claim**: While CallSign_Fjor does express their perspective and feelings about the situation, the focus is more on the sequence of events and actions rather than subjective opinions or unverifiable assertions.
   - **Elaborate**: There is an element of elaboration as CallSign_Fjor is expanding on their initial post about the situation with their friends. However, the primary function seems to be informing the audience about the events.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance does not contain any clear expressions of politeness or impoliteness. It is a straightforward recounting of events.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There are no indicators of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony. The utterance is presented as a sincere account of events.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate act is ""Inform"" as CallSign_Fjor is primarily recounting factual events related to their gaming experience.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance by CallSign_Fjor describes a situation where they played Terraria with friends, progressed further in a single-player mode, and then returned to play with friends. However, their friends lost interest when they found out about CallSign_Fjor's progress.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: CallSign_Fjor is providing a detailed account of their actions and the resulting reactions from their friends. The primary intent seems to be to share a personal experience and explain the situation to the audience. 

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides factual information about what happened during the gaming experience, including specific actions taken by CallSign_Fjor and the reactions of their friends. This aligns with the definition of ""Inform"" as providing verifiable information, even though it may be subjective in terms of the friends' reactions.
   - **Claim**: While CallSign_Fjor does express their perspective and feelings about the situation, the focus is more on the sequence of events and actions rather than subjective opinions or unverifiable assertions.
   - **Elaborate**: There is an element of elaboration as CallSign_Fjor is expanding on their initial post about the situation with their friends. However, the primary function seems to be informing the audience about the events.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: The utterance does not contain any clear expressions of politeness or impoliteness. It is a straightforward recounting of events.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There are no indicators of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony. The utterance is presented as a sincere account of events.

Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate act is ""Inform"" as CallSign_Fjor is primarily recounting factual events related to their gaming experience.

At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources. Their stance was that I invalidated them.,,Original post,,0.0,Inform,,reported,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The user, CallSign_Fjor, is discussing a recurring situation where their friends lose interest in games because CallSign_Fjor progresses faster. They share a specific example from a game called Pax Dei where their mining activities discouraged a friend who wanted to be a blacksmith.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is recounting a past event to illustrate a pattern of behavior they observe in their friends. The primary intent seems to be to inform others about this pattern and how it affects their gaming experiences with friends.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about a past event, describing what happened when they mined and shared resources with a friend.
   - **Claim**: The speaker is also expressing their perspective on the situation, suggesting their understanding of the friend's stance as feeling invalidated.
   - **Elaborate**: The speaker is expanding on a previous point made in the post about friends feeling discouraged by someone else's progression.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. The speaker is neutrally recounting an experience.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The speaker mentions the friend's stance as ""I invalidated them."" This could be considered reported speech since it reflects the friend's perspective indirectly. The speaker is not quoting the friend directly but rather summarizing their perceived stance.

Given these considerations, the primary act is **Inform** as the speaker is sharing information about past experiences to support their point. The mention of the friend's stance can be seen as **reported** speech.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. It's been a week and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.\n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources. Their stance was that I invalidated them.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The user, CallSign_Fjor, is discussing a recurring situation where their friends lose interest in games because CallSign_Fjor progresses faster. They share a specific example from a game called Pax Dei where their mining activities discouraged a friend who wanted to be a blacksmith.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is recounting a past event to illustrate a pattern of behavior they observe in their friends. The primary intent seems to be to inform others about this pattern and how it affects their gaming experiences with friends.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: The speaker is providing factual information about a past event, describing what happened when they mined and shared resources with a friend.
   - **Claim**: The speaker is also expressing their perspective on the situation, suggesting their understanding of the friend's stance as feeling invalidated.
   - **Elaborate**: The speaker is expanding on a previous point made in the post about friends feeling discouraged by someone else's progression.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. The speaker is neutrally recounting an experience.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The speaker mentions the friend's stance as ""I invalidated them."" This could be considered reported speech since it reflects the friend's perspective indirectly. The speaker is not quoting the friend directly but rather summarizing their perceived stance.

Given these considerations, the primary act is **Inform** as the speaker is sharing information about past experiences to support their point. The mention of the friend's stance can be seen as **reported** speech.

Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?"" This is part of a post where the user, CallSign_Fjor, expresses confusion about why their friends lost interest in playing a game with them after they progressed further in the game.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is expressing confusion and seeking understanding about why their actions (progressing in the game and acquiring resources) would discourage others. The speaker is asking two questions which are rhetorical in nature, as they do not expect a direct answer from the audience but rather express disbelief and seek to provoke thought or discussion.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Inquire**: The speaker is asking questions, but they are rhetorical, implying disbelief rather than seeking information.
   - **Claim**: The speaker is expressing their perspective or opinion on the situation, suggesting that they find it unreasonable for their actions to invalidate others.
   - **React**: The speaker is reacting to the situation with confusion and disbelief, but this is not the primary function.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. The tone is neutral, focused on expressing confusion and seeking understanding.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The questions are rhetorical, indicating that the utterance is non-bona fide communication. The speaker does not expect actual answers but uses the questions to express disbelief.

Given the rhetorical nature of the questions, the primary communicative act is **Claim**. The utterance is non-bona fide due to the rhetorical questions.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I. Herring (1994)\n\nBased on Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem and build a positive relationship, while negative politeness focuses on minimizing the imposition on the addressee and respecting their autonomy.\n\n| Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **+P** | Positive politeness: Affirm the addressee's positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated, accepted) through support, compliments, humor, solidarity                                             | \""Best wishes for a smooth re-entry.\""; \""I really respect that you pursued learning.\""; \""Thank you for the wishes.\"" |\n| **+N** | Negative politeness: Respect the addressee's negative face (desire to be free from imposition, maintain autonomy) through hedging, apologies, giving options                                      | \""I don't mean to sound cold, but…\""; \""You're correct, and so are the people here who say some things are mistakes\""; \""I understand what you were saying.\""; \""I hope I have answered some of the questions you are asking in the post.\"" |\n| **-P** | Violation of positive politeness: Attack the addressee's positive face through mocking, flaming, etc.                                                                                             | \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""; \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\"" |\n| **-N** | Violation of negative politeness: Attack the addressee's negative face through commands, imperatives, intrusive questions that impose on their autonomy (addressed to a stranger in a chat room)  | \""So how's school, love, family life?\""; \""You don't get to dictate morality\""; \""Remorse is the one thing that anyone with a conscience should have.\""; \""Did you do it?

They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. It's been a week and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.\n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources. Their stance was that I invalidated them.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #4 from CallSign_Fjor:\n\""I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources?

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance is ""I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?"" This is part of a post where the user, CallSign_Fjor, expresses confusion about why their friends lost interest in playing a game with them after they progressed further in the game.  

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is expressing confusion and seeking understanding about why their actions (progressing in the game and acquiring resources) would discourage others. The speaker is asking two questions which are rhetorical in nature, as they do not expect a direct answer from the audience but rather express disbelief and seek to provoke thought or discussion.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Inquire**: The speaker is asking questions, but they are rhetorical, implying disbelief rather than seeking information.
   - **Claim**: The speaker is expressing their perspective or opinion on the situation, suggesting that they find it unreasonable for their actions to invalidate others.
   - **React**: The speaker is reacting to the situation with confusion and disbelief, but this is not the primary function.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness expressed in this utterance. The tone is neutral, focused on expressing confusion and seeking understanding.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The questions are rhetorical, indicating that the utterance is non-bona fide communication. The speaker does not expect actual answers but uses the questions to express disbelief.

Given the rhetorical nature of the questions, the primary communicative act is **Claim**. The utterance is non-bona fide due to the rhetorical questions.

The speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is expressing confusion about why others are discouraged by someone progressing faster in a game. This is part of a larger post where they describe their experiences with friends losing interest in playing games together after CallSign_Fjor progresses further.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is expressing a subjective viewpoint about the mentality of players who feel discouraged by others' progression. This is a personal opinion and reflection on the situation.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about their lack of understanding and their perspective on gaming culture. 
   - **Inquire**: The speaker is not directly seeking information from others, but rather expressing their own lack of understanding.
   - **React**: The speaker is not simply reacting but providing an opinion and reasoning.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. The speaker is simply stating their perspective without attacking or supporting others.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance does not contain reported speech or sarcasm. The mention of ""there was a time when a player 'had the thing' it meant prestige"" is more of a reflection on past gaming culture rather than reported speech.

The primary communicative act is a **Claim**, as the speaker is expressing a subjective opinion and reflecting on their perspective regarding gaming culture.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. It's been a week and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.\n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources. Their stance was that I invalidated them.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is: ""I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player 'had the thing' it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you."" The speaker, CallSign_Fjor, is expressing confusion about why others are discouraged by someone progressing faster in a game. This is part of a larger post where they describe their experiences with friends losing interest in playing games together after CallSign_Fjor progresses further.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker is expressing a subjective viewpoint about the mentality of players who feel discouraged by others' progression. This is a personal opinion and reflection on the situation.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about their lack of understanding and their perspective on gaming culture. 
   - **Inquire**: The speaker is not directly seeking information from others, but rather expressing their own lack of understanding.
   - **React**: The speaker is not simply reacting but providing an opinion and reasoning.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in this utterance. The speaker is simply stating their perspective without attacking or supporting others.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: The utterance does not contain reported speech or sarcasm. The mention of ""there was a time when a player 'had the thing' it meant prestige"" is more of a reflection on past gaming culture rather than reported speech.

The primary communicative act is a **Claim**, as the speaker is expressing a subjective opinion and reflecting on their perspective regarding gaming culture.

6,1,250127,,AurelianoTampa,,Did you ask your friends? ,CallSign_Fjor,Comment,D2,55.0,Inquire,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""Did you ask your friends?"" from AurelianoTampa, which is a direct response to CallSign_Fjor's post about friends losing interest in playing games after CallSign_Fjor progressed further in them.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa seems to be prompting CallSign_Fjor to consider direct communication with their friends to understand their perspective on the situation. The question suggests that CallSign_Fjor might not have directly asked their friends about their feelings or reasons for losing interest.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inquire**: The utterance is a question seeking information about whether CallSign_Fjor has communicated with their friends. This is the most straightforward option.
   - **Invite**: Although the question could be interpreted as inviting CallSign_Fjor to consider asking their friends, the primary function here is to inquire about past actions rather than suggest future ones.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is a straightforward inquiry without any hedging or directness that would imply a politeness strategy.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony in the utterance. It appears to be a genuine question.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

It is an amalgam and distillation of Bach and Harnish's (1979) classification of speech acts, which is based on Searle's (1976) classification, and Francis and Hunston's (1992) classification of conversational speech acts. The taxonomy was designed to apply both to genres of CMC that are closer to traditional writing, such as email and blog posts, and to more conversational genres such as real-time text chat and text message exchanges. Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance is ""Did you ask your friends?"" from AurelianoTampa, which is a direct response to CallSign_Fjor's post about friends losing interest in playing games after CallSign_Fjor progressed further in them.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa seems to be prompting CallSign_Fjor to consider direct communication with their friends to understand their perspective on the situation. The question suggests that CallSign_Fjor might not have directly asked their friends about their feelings or reasons for losing interest.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inquire**: The utterance is a question seeking information about whether CallSign_Fjor has communicated with their friends. This is the most straightforward option.
   - **Invite**: Although the question could be interpreted as inviting CallSign_Fjor to consider asking their friends, the primary function here is to inquire about past actions rather than suggest future ones.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no explicit politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is a straightforward inquiry without any hedging or directness that would imply a politeness strategy.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication such as sarcasm or irony in the utterance. It appears to be a genuine question.

The context includes CallSign_Fjor's multiple inquiries about why his friends feel invalidated by his faster progression.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa's response seems to suggest that the answer to CallSign_Fjor's question lies with the friends themselves. The utterance implies that the friends are the ones who can best explain their feelings and reasons for losing interest.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides information by suggesting who has the answer to the question posed by CallSign_Fjor.
   - **Direct**: The utterance could be seen as indirectly directing CallSign_Fjor to ask the friends for their reasons.
   - **Invite**: It could be considered as inviting CallSign_Fjor to seek the answer from the friends.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in the utterance. It is a straightforward statement.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication. The utterance is sincere and straightforward.

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase.

Their stance was that I invalidated them.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""They'd be the ones with the answer."" is a direct response to CallSign_Fjor's post, which expresses confusion about why friends lose interest in playing games when someone progresses faster than them. The context includes CallSign_Fjor's multiple inquiries about why his friends feel invalidated by his faster progression.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa's response seems to suggest that the answer to CallSign_Fjor's question lies with the friends themselves. The utterance implies that the friends are the ones who can best explain their feelings and reasons for losing interest.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:
   - **Inform**: The utterance provides information by suggesting who has the answer to the question posed by CallSign_Fjor.
   - **Direct**: The utterance could be seen as indirectly directing CallSign_Fjor to ask the friends for their reasons.
   - **Invite**: It could be considered as inviting CallSign_Fjor to seek the answer from the friends.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear politeness or impoliteness expressed in the utterance. It is a straightforward statement.

5. **Check for meta-acts**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication. The utterance is sincere and straightforward.

The primary communicative act of the utterance is to provide information about where the answer to CallSign_Fjor's question can be found. Therefore, the most appropriate label is ""Inform"".

It ruins the surprise.",CallSign_Fjor,Comment,D2,55.0,Inform,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance by AurelianoTampa is in response to CallSign_Fjor's post about why their friends lost interest in playing games together after they progressed further in the game alone. AurelianoTampa provides an explanation for why CallSign_Fjor's friends might have felt discouraged.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa's primary intent seems to be to explain or provide an understanding of the friends' perspective to CallSign_Fjor. The user is trying to bridge the gap between CallSign_Fjor's confusion and the friends' reaction by offering a plausible reason.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: AurelianoTampa is providing information about why the friends might have reacted as they did, which could be considered an informative act.
   - **Elaborate**: The user is building on CallSign_Fjor's question and confusion by offering a detailed scenario that explains the friends' behavior.
   - **Claim**: The user is making a subjective assertion about the feelings and motivations of CallSign_Fjor's friends.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The tone of the message is neutral and does not contain any clear markers of politeness or impoliteness. The user is simply providing an explanation without any judgmental language.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no reported speech or non-bona fide communication in this utterance. The analogy about watching a show with friends is used to clarify the explanation, but it is not sarcastic or insincere.

Considering these aspects, the most appropriate act for this utterance is **Inform** because the user is primarily providing an explanation to inform CallSign_Fjor about the potential reasons for their friends' behavior.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The target utterance by AurelianoTampa is in response to CallSign_Fjor's post about why their friends lost interest in playing games together after they progressed further in the game alone. AurelianoTampa provides an explanation for why CallSign_Fjor's friends might have felt discouraged.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: AurelianoTampa's primary intent seems to be to explain or provide an understanding of the friends' perspective to CallSign_Fjor. The user is trying to bridge the gap between CallSign_Fjor's confusion and the friends' reaction by offering a plausible reason.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**:  
   - **Inform**: AurelianoTampa is providing information about why the friends might have reacted as they did, which could be considered an informative act.
   - **Elaborate**: The user is building on CallSign_Fjor's question and confusion by offering a detailed scenario that explains the friends' behavior.
   - **Claim**: The user is making a subjective assertion about the feelings and motivations of CallSign_Fjor's friends.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: The tone of the message is neutral and does not contain any clear markers of politeness or impoliteness. The user is simply providing an explanation without any judgmental language.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no reported speech or non-bona fide communication in this utterance. The analogy about watching a show with friends is used to clarify the explanation, but it is not sarcastic or insincere.

Considering these aspects, the most appropriate act for this utterance is **Inform** because the user is primarily providing an explanation to inform CallSign_Fjor about the potential reasons for their friends' behavior.

9,1,250127,,wyldmage,,Exactly this.,AurelianoTampa,Reply,D7,7.0,Accept,,,"1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Exactly this."" by wyldmage is a response to AurelianoTampa's explanation in Utterance #8. AurelianoTampa suggests that the friends wanted to experience the game together and that the original poster's prior solo progression might have diminished their enjoyment.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: Wyldmage's utterance is an affirmation of AurelianoTampa's explanation. It signals agreement with the reasoning provided by AurelianoTampa.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Accept**: The utterance ""Exactly this."" is a clear expression of concurrence with the previous statement, making ""Accept"" a strong candidate.
   - **React**: While ""Exactly this."" could be seen as a reaction, the specific context of agreeing with a detailed explanation leans more towards acceptance.
   - **Elaborate**: There is no additional commentary or explanation provided by wyldmage, so this option is not applicable.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear indication of politeness or impoliteness in this brief agreement statement. It is neutral.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no reported speech or non-bona fide communication in this straightforward agreement.

The primary communicative act is ""Accept"" as wyldmage is agreeing with AurelianoTampa's reasoning without adding any additional commentary or complexity.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions.

The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. It's been a week and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.\n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources. Their stance was that I invalidated them.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #9 from wyldmage:\n\""Exactly this.\""\n\nUtterance #9 is a reply to user \""AurelianoTampa\"".

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance ""Exactly this."" by wyldmage is a response to AurelianoTampa's explanation in Utterance #8. AurelianoTampa suggests that the friends wanted to experience the game together and that the original poster's prior solo progression might have diminished their enjoyment.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: Wyldmage's utterance is an affirmation of AurelianoTampa's explanation. It signals agreement with the reasoning provided by AurelianoTampa.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Accept**: The utterance ""Exactly this."" is a clear expression of concurrence with the previous statement, making ""Accept"" a strong candidate.
   - **React**: While ""Exactly this."" could be seen as a reaction, the specific context of agreeing with a detailed explanation leans more towards acceptance.
   - **Elaborate**: There is no additional commentary or explanation provided by wyldmage, so this option is not applicable.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear indication of politeness or impoliteness in this brief agreement statement. It is neutral.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no reported speech or non-bona fide communication in this straightforward agreement.

The primary communicative act is ""Accept"" as wyldmage is agreeing with AurelianoTampa's reasoning without adding any additional commentary or complexity.

AurelianoTampa suggested that the friends wanted to explore the game together, and wyldmage elaborates on this by contrasting the values of the OP and his friends.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker seems to be explaining or clarifying a possible reason for the friends' behavior. They are providing an analysis of the situation by identifying differing values between the OP and his friends.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Elaborate**: wyldmage is expanding on AurelianoTampa's explanation by providing a more detailed analysis of the situation, focusing on the differing values of the OP and his friends.
   - **Inform**: They are providing information about the situation by identifying the values of the OP and his friends.
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about the differing values, which could be considered a claim.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is a neutral explanation of the situation.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication. The utterance is a straightforward explanation.

Given the context and the nature of the utterance, ""Elaborate"" seems to be the most appropriate act as wyldmage is expanding on the previous explanation provided by AurelianoTampa.","[{""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""# CMC Communicative Act Annotation System\n\nYou are an annotation assistant for a research project on computer-mediated communication (CMC).

Consisting of 18 act categories and two meta-act categories, the CMC Act Taxonomy makes more fine-grained distinctions than Searle's taxonomy, while being easier to apply reliably than the 33 acts identified by Francis and Hunston.\n\n## CMC Communicative Act Labels (18 total)\n\nUse the following definitions and examples to identify the most appropriate label for each utterance:\n\n| Act | Explanation                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **Accept** | Concur, agree, acquiesce, approve; acknowledge what someone else said or did; and you cannot accept your own speech or behavior                                       | \""Definitely\""; \""I agree\""; \""I see your point.\"" |\n| **Apologize** | Humble oneself, self-deprecate                                                                                                                                        | \""I'm sorry.\""; \""Oops my fault :(\"" |\n| **Behave** | Perform a virtual action (that does not primarily function as another CMC act)                                                                                        | \""dances with joy\""; \""*sips tea\""; \""A newly minted assistant professor enters the chat.\"" |\n| **Claim** | Make a subjective assertion that is unverifiable in principle, e.g., because it describes a state of mind, feeling, or belief; assert, opine, speculate               | \""I love you.\""; \""That's the nicest thing you ever said.\"" |\n| **Congratulate** | Celebrate/praise someone else's accomplishment; Express confidence in their future success, encourage; Validate, support                                              | \""Well done!\""; \""Congratulations!\""; \""You've got this!\""; \""What you did was perfectly logical.\"" |\n| **Desire (Irrealis)** | Want, hope, wish; Promise, predict, speculate; Hypothetical; Counterfactual                                                                                           | \""I would like to meet him.\""; \""She will join us after class.\""; \""If you're driving, I'll pay for gas.\""; \""If she hadn't left, I would've stayed longer.\"" |\n| **Direct** | Command, demand; prohibit; permit; require; advise                                                                                                                    | \""Provide evidence for your claim.\""; \""You have to register first.\""; \""They should stop doing that.\"" |\n| **Elaborate** | Comment on, explain, or paraphrase a (usually one's own) previous utterance                                                                                           | \""(His position is untenable.)

In non-bona fide communication, the surface form of the utterance does not match the utterance producer's actual intended meaning; in that sense, it is insincere. Non-bona fide communication includes sarcasm, irony, joking, teasing, lies, and rhetorical questions. Code non-bona fide utterances as if they were sincere, and add a meta-code to indicate that the utterance is non-bona fide. | \""The human failed the Turing test, haha.\"" → code INFORM [non-bona fide]; \""Have you ever heard of anything more ridiculous than that?\"" → code INQUIRE [non-bona fide] |\n\nIn addition to direct quotations, reported acts may also be expressed indirectly or through paraphrase. In these cases, code the embedded proposition as if it were spoken directly.\n\n- Example: \""She said she would help tomorrow.\"" → code DESIRE [reported]  \n- Example: \""He told me he had already finished.\"" → code INFORM [reported]  \n\n\n## Politeness & Impoliteness Annotation\n\nOnly annotate when a clear (non-)politeness act is present, as defined by the subtypes described below.\n\n### I. Herring (1994)\n\nBased on Brown and Levinson's (1987) Politeness Theory: Positive politeness aims to enhance the addressee's self-esteem and build a positive relationship, while negative politeness focuses on minimizing the imposition on the addressee and respecting their autonomy.\n\n| Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example(s) |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| **+P** | Positive politeness: Affirm the addressee's positive face (desire to be liked, appreciated, accepted) through support, compliments, humor, solidarity                                             | \""Best wishes for a smooth re-entry.\""; \""I really respect that you pursued learning.\""; \""Thank you for the wishes.\"" |\n| **+N** | Negative politeness: Respect the addressee's negative face (desire to be free from imposition, maintain autonomy) through hedging, apologies, giving options                                      | \""I don't mean to sound cold, but…\""; \""You're correct, and so are the people here who say some things are mistakes\""; \""I understand what you were saying.\""; \""I hope I have answered some of the questions you are asking in the post.\"" |\n| **-P** | Violation of positive politeness: Attack the addressee's positive face through mocking, flaming, etc.                                                                                             | \""It's not rocket science, and it's pathetic if you genuinely can't see the difference.\""; \""You are just an angry little person\""; \""People like you are the real danger because you always want to idolize the 'reformed thug or murderer' but never the people who don't murder at all.\"" |\n| **-N** | Violation of negative politeness: Attack the addressee's negative face through commands, imperatives, intrusive questions that impose on their autonomy (addressed to a stranger in a chat room)  | \""So how's school, love, family life?\""; \""You don't get to dictate morality\""; \""Remorse is the one thing that anyone with a conscience should have.\""; \""Did you do it?

Do not assign a separate act.  \n  - Example: \""I ALREADY TOLD YOU\"" → code REJECT  \n  - Example: \""THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!\"" → code THANK  \n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn your annotation as a **single JSON object** wrapped in the specified tags:\n\n```\n[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""<ACT>\"",\""politeness\"":\""<POL>\"",\""meta\"":\""<META>\""}[/ANNOT]\n```\n\n## Reasoning (Optional)\n\nIf chain-of-thought reasoning is requested, provide detailed step-by-step analysis inside:\n\n```\n[REASON] your reasoning here [/REASON]\n```\n\nPlace `[REASON]...[/REASON]` **immediately before** the `[ANNOT]` block.\n\n### Field Specifications\n\n- **act**: One of the 18 communicative acts (required)\n- **politeness**: Politeness code (+P, +N, -P, -N) with subtype like \""-P [Insult]\"" (optional)\n- **meta**: Meta-act tags separated by commas if multiple (optional)\n\n### Examples\n\n- Basic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Accept\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With politeness: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Reject\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P [Insult]\"",\""meta\"":\""\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- With meta-act: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Claim\"",\""politeness\"":\""\"",\""meta\"":\""reported\""}[/ANNOT]`\n- Sarcastic: `[ANNOT]{\""act\"":\""Congratulate\"",\""politeness\"":\""-P\"",\""meta\"":\""non-bona fide\""}[/ANNOT]`\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n- **One act per utterance**: Select the single most appropriate primary function\n- **Evidence-based**: Ground your decision in observable linguistic and contextual features\n- **Consistent**: Apply the taxonomy definitions systematically\n- **Contextual**: Always consider the immediate conversational context\n- **Precise**: Use the most specific appropriate label from the taxonomy""}, {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""**Task Instruction**: You are given a single utterance from Reddit. Please read the background and surrounding context carefully, then decide on the communicative act of the target utterance, its politeness value (if clearly expressed), and any applicable meta-acts.

For politeness and impoliteness, refer to Herring (1994) and Culpeper's (2011a) frameworks. For meta-acts such as reported and non-bona fide speech, follow the definitions included in the taxonomy.\n\n**Background Context**: A Reddit user (CallSign_Fjor) posts in r/gaming that their friends lost interest in finishing Terraria and other games with them because the user had progressed farther, even though the user avoided using end-game gear and shared resources. The post asks why some players feel 'invalidated' by someone else's faster progression.\n\nThread starter messages:\n- What's up with people not wanting to play a game because someone else has progressed further?\n- Recently playing terraria with friends. They were moving a bit slow so I started a single player world and finished it. When I went back to play with friends I used none of my new gear and only used what would be available. I had a bunch of extra summons so everyone could get stuff from the bosses we were killing and someone noted that I had extra stuff (the summons). When I told them I went and beat the game in single player, three of them were immediately uninterested in finishing and haven't joined back on. It's been a week and their excuse is that I've already explored everything and beat the game.\n- This isn't the first time this has happened. At one point in Pax Dei I did some extra mining and the player who wanted to be a blacksmith quit because I was also mining and giving them resources. Their stance was that I invalidated them.\n- I don't get it, why wouldn't you want more people who can mine for rare resources? Why does me getting rare resources invalidate someone else mining?\n- I do not understand the mentality of people being discouraged by someone else's progression. There was a time when a player \""had the thing\"" it meant prestige and you wanted to be more like them, not throw your hands up because someone already had endgame armor before you.\n\n**Local Context**: We will be annotating Utterance #10 from wyldmage:\n\""OP values \""playing a game with friends\"". His friends value \""exploring a game with friends\"".\""\n\nUtterance #10 is a reply to user \""AurelianoTampa\"". The following earlier messages by AurelianoTampa may help contextualize the reply:\n- Utterance #6: \""Did you ask your friends?\""\n- Utterance #7: \""They'd be the ones with the answer.\""\n- Utterance #8: \""As someone not involved, it sounds like they wanted to play and discover the game together. Knowing you had already gone through everything and now were just kinda babysitting them probably took the wind out of their sails and made it less enjoyable. They wanted a new experience as a group, and you went and had the experience on your own. Guessing it's a bit like wanting to watch a show with a group of friends, but one of them binged it beforehand and keeps going \""Oh man, this episode is going to be awesome, you won't believe it!\"" It ruins the surprise.\""\n\nOther users also replied to wyldmage afterward. Here are some such replies:\n- Utterance #57 from McSuede: \""You know, I'll have to agree in this instance.\""\n- Utterance #58 from McSuede: \""I caught myself defending the wider idea of playing with someone with experience and not thinking about this particular story.\""\n- Utterance #59 from McSuede: \""If you go into a game with the agreement that you are going to play together and match each other's pace, you're definitely in the wrong if you \""read ahead\"".\""\n\n**Reasoning**: Provide step-by-step analysis inside [REASON]…[/REASON] before your final answer.

1. **Read the target utterance in context**: The utterance by wyldmage is a response to AurelianoTampa's explanation of why the friends might have lost interest in playing the game together. AurelianoTampa suggested that the friends wanted to explore the game together, and wyldmage elaborates on this by contrasting the values of the OP and his friends.

2. **Identify the speaker's primary communicative intent**: The speaker seems to be explaining or clarifying a possible reason for the friends' behavior. They are providing an analysis of the situation by identifying differing values between the OP and his friends.

3. **Consider 2-3 most plausible act options**: 
   - **Elaborate**: wyldmage is expanding on AurelianoTampa's explanation by providing a more detailed analysis of the situation, focusing on the differing values of the OP and his friends.
   - **Inform**: They are providing information about the situation by identifying the values of the OP and his friends.
   - **Claim**: The speaker is making a subjective assertion about the differing values, which could be considered a claim.

4. **Evaluate politeness/impoliteness if clearly expressed**: There is no clear expression of politeness or impoliteness in the utterance. It is a neutral explanation of the situation.

5. **Check for meta-acts (reported speech, sarcasm, etc.)**: There is no indication of reported speech or non-bona fide communication. The utterance is a straightforward explanation.

Given the context and the nature of the utterance, ""Elaborate"" seems to be the most appropriate act as wyldmage is expanding on the previous explanation provided by AurelianoTampa.

177,1,250127,,afallingape,,"Gaming is pleasurable because games are designed to satisfy our natural problem solving process. Encounter a problem, compare to a previous database, find pattern similarities, trial and error, tweak, repeat. If someone takes the discovery process away (i.e. spoilers or carrying or looking at a guide), it ruins the enjoyment. The enjoyment of a game isn't in beating a boss or getting through whatever obstacle, it's in the process of solving the problem and getting better. If you're beating the game solo, going back to your friends, and then carrying or coaching - you're ruining their ability to enjoy the game. Even if you're just keeping quiet and trying to let them figure it out, it sucks the fun out of the room because they know that you know the answer and you can't be a part of their process.",CallSign_Fjor,Comment,D2,1.0,,,,,,,,
